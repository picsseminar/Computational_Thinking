## Algorithm Challenges

# Name:

# Algorithm Challenge 1
- Get a set of 13 cards from Mark.
- Make sure all of the cards have the same suit.
- With the cards facedown, shuffle your stack.
- While flipping just one card at a time, put the cards in order, A23...K.
- Write out detailed instructions so that another person can replicate your process.

# Algorithm Challenge 2
- Find a partner (or two) where all partners have different suits of cards.
- Combine your cards into one deck and shuffle it well.
- While flipping just one card at a time, put the cards in order, A23...K where all hearts precede clubs, which precede diamonds, which precede spades.
- Write detailed instructions so that another group can replicate your process.

# Algorithm Challenge 3
- Still in your same groups, re-shuffle your cards.
- Divide your cards into two packs (they should be a mix of each suit, and roughly equal in size).
- Sort the two packs independently using your instructions from Challenge 2.
- Combine the two decks into one sorted deck.
- Write detailed instructions for combining the decks.

# Algorithm Challenge 4
- Write up a detailed 'game plan' for playing tic-tac-toe.
- Your instructions should guarantee that you either win or tie every game.
- Make your instructions as concise as possible without introducing ambiguity.
