# Computational Thinking

## Elements:
* Decomposition (break a big problem into smaller ones)
* Pattern Recognition 
* Abstraction (removing details to get to the big picture)
* Algorithm Design (writing directions)

## Decomposition:
- Breaking a research paper into steps (Asking a question, finding sources, draft, revision, etc)
- Making tasks for planning Bash (finding a date, finding a location, selling tickets, decorating, etc)
- Sketching a polynomial without a graphing utility.  What are some sub-tasks to make this easier?

## Pattern Recognition:
- Phases of the moon
- Length of seasons
- Is this a fish?

# Abstraction:
- Ford Focus, Toyota Camry, Tesla Model 3 -> Cars
- Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Plane -> Transportation
- Tiny House, Dorm, Apartment, Condo, House -> Housing
- Maps -> Mathematical Graphs

## Algorithm:
- Cake recipe
- Finding the median of a set of numbers
- Pre-game rituals

In this repository, you will find two additional files, Pattern_Recognition_Challenges and Algorithm_Challenges.
Edit those files with your answers and commit the changes to GitHub.
